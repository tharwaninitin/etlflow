* **prefix** [String] - Prefix of the object. 
* **key** [String] - The key being waited on. It is relative path from root level after prefix.
* **retry** [Int] - Number of retries before failing the step.
* **spaced** [Duration] - Each retry is done after waiting of duration specified in this field.

### Example 1
Below example waits for a file **temp/ratings.parquet** to be present in a GCS bucket named **gcs_bucket**. 

```scala mdoc

import etlflow.etlsteps.GCSSensorStep
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val step = GCSSensorStep(
         name    = "GCSKeySensor",
         bucket  = "gcs_bucket",
         prefix  = "temp",
         key     = "ratings.parquet",
         retry   = 10,
         spaced  = 5.second
)
