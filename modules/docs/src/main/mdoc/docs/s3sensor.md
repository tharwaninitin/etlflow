```scala mdoc

import etlflow.etlsteps._
import software.amazon.awssdk.regions.Region
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val step = S3SensorStep(
         name    = "S3KeySensor",
         bucket  = "s3_bucket",
         prefix  = "temp",
         key     = "ratings.parquet",
         retry   = 10,
         spaced  = 5.second,
